# SmartKeg

### Overview
There are a bunch of "Smart Keg" projects out there.  This one is my own implmentation of one tailored to fit my needs. In the references section you will find other projects that I used as a guideline to build this one.  You can also find more detailed directions of the build at [Randar Labs][df1].

This project aims to use an Arduino to manage the following:
* Monitor temperature inside the kegerator
* Activate a power outlet when beer is pouring (Beer light plugged into outlet)
* Count how many beers are left in the keg

Supplies used:
* [Arduino UNO Rev 3] - $24.95
* [2.8" TFT Touch Shield for Arduino with Capacitive Touch] - $49.99
* [TOOGOO DC 5V Coil Relay Module for SCM Development/Home Appliance Control] - $2.69
* [Adafruit Liquid Flow Meter - Plastic 1/2" NPS Threaded] - $21.10
* [DROK Waterproof Temperature Sensor DS18B20] - $5.99

### Version
0.0.1 Alpha

**Welcome to the start of it**

### References

SmartKeg is based off of a number of open source projects:

* [Smart Kegerator v1] & [Smart Kegerator v2]
* [KegDuino]
* [Tweeting Kegerator]
* [Arduino and Relays]
* [Plugduino]
* [Kegbot Kegerator Project]
